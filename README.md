# Tiki Calendar

Tiki Calendar is a Linux personal desktop calendar developed using C and [Gtk4](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/).


![](tikicalendar.png)

## Core Features

* built with Gtk4.6
* event title, location, type, start and end time can be entered and edited
* bespoke month calendar which allows days with events to be colour marked
* priority events can be separately colour marked*
* bespoke flat-file csv database with memory dynamically allocated for up to 5000 records
* audio for speaking the date and speech tags
* binary for 64-bit Gtk4 distributions


## Deployment

### Prebuilt Binary

A 64 bit prebuilt binary is available and can be downloaded from [binary](https://github.com/crispinalan/tikicalendar/tree/main/binary) and can be used with Linux distributions that have Gtk4 in their repositories such as Fedora 35 onwards, Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian Bookworm (in testing) etc.

Assuming that the Gtk4 base libraries are installed the Tiki Calendar binary can be run from the terminal using:

```
./tikicalendar
```

or double click on the tikicalendar file. Make sure it has executable permissions. Right click on it, then select permissions and ensure "Allow executing file as program" is selected. Audio output requires that the alsa-utils package is installed (this is usually installed by default).

Use a menu editor such as [MenuLibre](https://github.com/bluesabre/menulibre) to create a launcher for Tiki Calendar.

The database called "eventsdb.csv" is located in the working directory. With Tiki Calendar you can use the following menu item

```
Help->Information
```
to show the current working directory where the events database is located.


## Build From Source

The C source code for the Tiki Calendar project is provided in the src directory.

You need the Gtk4 development libraries and the gcc compiler.

### Fedora

With Fedora you need to install the following packages.

```
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel-docs
sudo dnf install glib-devel
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel
```

### Ubuntu and Debian Bookworm


With both Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian Bookworm (in testing) and you need to install the following packages

```
apt install build-essential
apt install libgtk-4-dev
apt install gtk-4-examples
apt install libasound2-dev
```
The packages:
```
apt install libglib2.0-dev
apt install alsa-utils
```
are needed but should be installed by default.

With Ubuntu 22.04 the base Gtk4 libraries should be installed by default. With other Ubuntu based distributions you may have to install these using the command below.

```
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1
```

Use the MAKEFILE to compile.

```
make
./tikicalendar
```
Geany can be used as an Integrated Development Environment when using Gtk only Linux distributions.

## Calendar Usage

### Adding New Event

* Select event date using the calendar.
* Click the New button on the headerbar to invoke the "New Event" dialog.
* Enter the event title.
* Enter the location.
* Enter start and end times.
* Events are sorted by start time when displayed.
* A colour marker is placed on a day in the calendar which has an event.
* Navigate through the year using the calendar to add events.

### Editing Existing Event

* Select the event in the list view and click the Edit button on the headerbar to edit.
* Change details as appropriate.

### Calendar Options

* Use the Calendar Options dialog in the hamburger menu to change calendar options

![](calendar-options.png)

You can show public holidays on the calendar and event end-times in the list view. You can change the colours and borders of the current day (today), event days and public holidays. Days with high priority events can have a separate colour.

Startup notfication requires that the package libnotify-bin is installed.

```
sudo apt install libnotify-bin
```


## Speech

Tiki Calendar is not meant to be a talking calendar. See my [Talk Calendar](https://github.com/crispinalan/talkcalendar) Qt project for a talking calendar. However, it does have some limited speech capability for reading out the dates and speech tags. Ensure that the talk directory containing speech wav files is located in the current working directory.

* Enable talking in Talk Options
* Click on a calendar date with events
* Press the spacebar to read out the selected date, event number, event times and any speech tags if used
* Enable "Talk At Startup" in the Talk Options to read out the date for the current day and other details when the calendar is started

### Talk Options

* Use the Talk Options dialog in the hamburger menu to choose what you want to speak.

![](talk-options.png)


### Speech Tags

A speech tag is a keyword (e.g. birthday) which if added into the title text is read out by Tiki Calendar to give an indication of the type of event.

The following tag words have been implemented relating to personal events

```
    activity, alert, anniversary, appointment,
    bank, birthday, boxing,
    calendar, christmas,
    day, dentist, doctor,
    easter, event, events,
    family, friends, funeral,
    halloween, holiday, hospital,
    important, information,
    meal, medical, meeting,
    new, note,
    party, payment, priority, public
    reminder, restaurant,
    travel,
    valentine, visit,
    wedding,
    year
```
Event speech tagging can be effective for a quick audio overview of day events. You can combine speech tags. Examples include  "public holiday", "christmas day", "new year", "doctor appointment", "payment reminder" etc. If no speech tag is recognised then nothing is read out.

### Help

* Use the Information dialog to display current application preferences including the current working directory in which the eventsdb.csv file is stored


* Use the About dialog to display current version.


### Keyboard Shortcuts
```
Speak		Spacebar
Today		Home Key
```

## Startup Applications

Add Tiki Calendar to your start-up programs to read out the date and any event details when the computer is switched on.

With the GNOME desktop use the GNOME "Tweak Tool" to add Tiki Calendar to your startup applications if required.

## History

This is a hobby project under development to learn Gtk programming.

The first iteration of the Tiki Calendar project used Gtk3 but then migrated to the newer Gtk4 toolkit. This project was forked and so can be found on github elsewhere. This Gtk4 version of Tiki Calendar uses a new bespoke flat-file csv database (rather than sqlite) with memory dynamically allocated for up to 5000 records. The events storage file is called "eventsdb.csv" and should be located in the current working directory. The talk directory containing the wav speech files should also be located in the current working directory.

I developed this calendar application to learn Gtk as at the time I was concerned that Qt may become closed source when the Qt Company announced that the Qt LTS versions and the offline installer were to become commercial-only [Qt licensing changes](https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-offering-changes-2020).  However, this proved not to be the case. Infact the Qt Company have released Qt 5.15.6 as [open-source](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Qt-5.15.6-LTS-Open-Source). Consequently, I continued developing my main Qt calendar application called [Talk Calendar](https://github.com/crispinalan/talkcalendar). This project is a Gtk4 Calendar and to avoid any confusion with my Qt Talk Calendar project I have called it Tiki Calendar. Tiki is an acronym for Tightly Integrated Knowledge Infrastructure. Tiki Calendar does have some limited speech capability using a local directory of speech files but is not indended to be a talking calendar. The idea was to have date reader on startup but I added a few more speech features such as tags.



## Gtk4 Depreciations

I have been using GTk4.6.6 for developing Tiki Calendar. To determine the version of Gtk4 running on a Linux system use the following terminal command.

```
dpkg -l | grep libgtk
```

Gtk have announced on their [Gtk4 api website](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/) that the following classes

```
AppChooserButton, AppChooserDialog, AppChooserWidget,
CellArea,CellAreaBox, CellAreaContext, CellRenderer, CellRendererAccel, CellRendererCombo, CellRendererPixbuf, CellRendererProgress, CellRendererSpin, CellRendererSpinner, CellRendererText, CellRendererToggle,
ColorButton, ColorChooserDialog, ColorChooserWidget,
ComboBox, ComboBoxText,
Dialog,
EntryCompletion,
FileChooserDialog,FileChooserNative, FileChooserWidget,
IconView,
ListStore, LockButton,
MessageDialog,
Statusbar, StyleContext
TreeModelFilter,TreeModelSort, TreeSelection, TreeStore, TreeView, TreeViewColumn,
VolumeButton
```

are being deprecated in Gtk4 version 4.10 onwards.

I was aware that it was the intention of Gtk developers to eventually replace GtkTreeView and GtkComboBox with [list widgets](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/06/08/more-on-lists-in-gtk-4/) and so I did not use these classes in the development of this calendar. See my migration notes below.

However, I was not aware that ColorButton, ColorChooserDialog were being depreciated as I use functions such as [gtk_color_chooser_get_rgba](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/method.ColorChooser.get_rgba.html) labelled "depreciated 4.10". I use this to allow the calendar user to select different colours for days with events, days with priority events and the today colour. I will have to give some thought on how to rewrite this code as other classes such as [GtkColorDialog](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.ColorDialog.html) are labeled "unstable since: 4.10".

The ListStore class is going to be depreciated in Gtk4.10 and I am assuming that you now have to use [Gio ListStore](https://docs.gtk.org/gio/ctor.ListStore.new.html). This means functions such as [gtk_list_store_new()](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/ctor.ListStore.new.html) used to creates a new list store are labeled "deprecated: 4.10". Fortunately, I have used GListStore in this calendar project creating a new GListStore with [g_list_store_new](https://docs.gtk.org/gio/ctor.ListStore.new.html).


The removal of MessageDialog will also require the code base to be changed as the function [gtk_message_dialog_new](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/ctor.MessageDialog.new.html) is being depreciated. I am assuming that you have to use [GtkAlertDialog](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.AlertDialog.html) instead but this is also labelled "unstable since: 4.10".

The current Tiki Calendar code base will need a major overhall to deal with the Gtk4.10 depreciations.

GTK developers are planning the [Gtk5](https://www.phoronix.com/news/GTK5-Likely-After-GTK-4.12) toolkit discussing making it a Wayland only [release](https://www.phoronix.com/news/GTK5-Might-Drop-X11).


## My Gtk3 to Gtk4 Migration Notes

These notes may be of help if your are migrating a C Gtk3 project to Gtk4.

Gtk4 uses [list widgets](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/migrating-3to4.html#consider-porting-to-the-new-list-widgets) such as GtkListBox and porting the Gtk3 version of this Calendar project has involved replacing the display of events with a GtkListBox. A significant effort had to be invested into this aspect of the porting. There is an article on scalable lists in gtk4 [here](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/06/07/scalable-lists-in-gtk-4/).

Gtk have said [publically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjF-VotgfeY&t=824s) that it is their intention to eventually replace GtkTreeView and GtkComboBox with [list widgets](https://blog.gtk.org/2020/06/08/more-on-lists-in-gtk-4/). The GtkListBox widget provides a vertical list and can be sorted (in this application events are sorted by start time and then displayed). The application work flow has had to be changed as headerbar buttons are now used to create a new event, edit and delete a selected event in the list. I have used buttons with text labels (New, Edit, Delete) but there is now an option for using Adwaita button icons (subject to change).

In Gtk4.0, the function

```
gtk_window_set_position(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER);
```

has been depreciated and so has had to be removed from the code. See this [discussion](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/how-to-center-gtkwindows-in-gtk4/3112).

In Gtk4, the function

```
gtk_dialog_run()
```

has been depreciated. This has been less of an issue as callback functions have been written for the “response” events. See this [discussion](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/how-should-i-replace-a-gtk-dialog-run-in-gtk-4/3501).

I could not place a visual marker on a particular GtkCalendar day using the "gtk_calendar_mark_day()" function. The [GtkInspector](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK/Inspector?action=show&redirect=Projects%2FGTK%2B%2FInspector) debugging tool does not reveal any obvious CSS style theme option that should to be used to do this. Consequently, I have ended up writing a bespoke month calendar which allows days with events to be colour marked.

The calendar has been developed using the Gtk4 grid layout [manager](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Grid.html) which arranges child widgets in rows and columns. In this case the layout manager arranges buttons in a grid. Again a significant effort has had to be invested in this aspect of the porting.

The function "gtk_spin_button_set_text()" has gone. The documented approach for showing spin button [leading zeros](https://people.gnome.org/~ebassi/docs/_build/Gtk/4.0/signal.SpinButton.output.html) doesn't work with gtk4. Consequently, I have had to change the new and edit event dialogs. The spin boxes for the start and end times now accept floating point values which are now stored in the database as floating point values. I have also removed the priority combobox as comboboxes are on the Gtk depreciation hit list (see list widget discussion above) and replaced it with a high prirority check button.

Other depreciations include "gtk_application_set_app_menu()" as discussed [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/ApplicationMenu). The function "gtk_button_set_image()" has gone. In the context of menu development it can be replaced with "gtk_menu_button_set_icon_name()".

## Libadwaita

The GNOME project uses a library called libadwaita which I believe is like a companion library for Gtk4 as you have to include both the libadwaita and Gtk libraries in a GNOME project. From what I can make out, libadwaita is a Gtk4 library for implementing the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines using the [Adwaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwaita_(design_language)) design language. So if I undertand things correctly, Gtk4 is used for UI elements (e.g. buttons, text entry widgets) and layout managers while libadwaita provides GNOME styling and behaviour for these widgets.  It also adds things like notifications and animations.

I have avoided using libadwaita keeping this a Gtk4 only project. A simple notification system has been implemented using libnotify in this project.
